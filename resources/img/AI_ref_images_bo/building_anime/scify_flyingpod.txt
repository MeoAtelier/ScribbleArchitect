A steampunk-style flying city, suspended above the cliffside of an ancient town with many small houses and bridges, drawn in pen and ink in the style of Moebius. The main colors include orange and blue tones, while details like buildings, people on foot or bicycle, crows, etc. add depth to the scene. A large mechanical robot floats over it all.
