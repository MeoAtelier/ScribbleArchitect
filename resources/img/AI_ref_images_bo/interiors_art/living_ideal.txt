A modernist house with high ceilings, large windows and lots of natural light, decorated in the style of Eames, painted by Alex Colville, with bookshelves, art on walls, a fireplace, a coffee table, chairs and sofa. A rug is laid out across part of one wall. In front there's an orange abstract painting on canvas. The mood should be relaxed and cozy.
